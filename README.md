# DocuBot 

DocuBot is a smartbot for your PDF document. It was actually born out of a personal need to  summarize research papers for my research project :p

Built using by Python, Streamlit, LangChain, PyPDF2, and the Hugging Face API, DocuBot simplifies the process of extracting and querying information from multiple PDFs.

Primary features:
- **Multiple PDF Support**
- **Conversational Retrieval**
- **Smart Language Model**
